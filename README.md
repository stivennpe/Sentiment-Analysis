# Sentiment-Analysis
Basic implementation of Sentiment Analysis models.

Outline
-----
Folder Keras-LSTM includes the implementation of a Sentiment Analysis model in Keras. Specs/Hyperparameters:
- Dropout= 0.5
- Activation = Sigmoid
- LSTM
- Loss= Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer= Adam

Folder Pytorch- RNN includes the following implementations:
- LogisticRegression
- RandomForestClassifier
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)


Both were created with publically available datasets and for 5 epochs.
